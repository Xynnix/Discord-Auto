# Auto Bot
### Automated Basic bot setup script for discord.js

All you need to do is:

- run `bash run.sh`
- Then insert your bot token in the config.json file
- run `node .`

> if done correctly.you will see your bot online and you can send `ping` command with your prefix in the beginning of the message!

â€¢ Editing the index.js manually is allowed since how else would you make it do more?
